*ACADEMIC PROJECTS* \
*Multi-tier Cloud Native application on AWS (ITMO 544 - Cloud Computing Technologies)* \
_AWS | EC2 | Lambda | PHP SDK | SNS | DynamoDB | CLI | Python | OpenCV_ \
â€¢ Produced & upgraded a cloud-native application to go serverless & migrate to a NoSQL cloud database DynamoDB. \
â€¢ Developed a Python Lambda function on OpenCV layers to retrieve & manipulate image to save server cost. \
â€¢ Utilized launch configuration to implement auto-scaling and leveraged load balancer to boot EC2 instances. \
*Comparing Data Paradigms for Big Data (ITMD 521 â€“ Client Server Technologies)* \
_Vagrant | Hadoop | Sqoop |Linux | Java | Graphana_ \
â€¢ Ran custom MapReduce jobs (programmed Mapper, Reducer & Driver) on GB scale text to calculate job execution time. \
â€¢ Compared various configurations using datasets of different sizes and analyzed cluster using Graphana. \
â€¢ Transferred data from text files to MySQL database using custom Java programs and retrieved data using Sqoop. \
â€¢ It was found that SQL is about 15 times faster than MapReduce given that the data is already inserted. \
*Bank Marketing Analysis (ITMD 527 â€“ Data Analytics)* \
_R | NaÃ¯ve Bayesâ€™ | Decision Tree | K-Nearest Neighbors | Regression | Random Forest | Neural Network_ \
â€¢ Classified potential customers that would answer in positive when offered to buy long term loan deposit. \
â€¢ Built NB, DT, KNN, LR: full, stepwise forward and stepwise backward, RF and NN classification models. \
â€¢ KNN was determined to be the algorithm with the best accuracy of 95.17% but was also the most time costliest. \
