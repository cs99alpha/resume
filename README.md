##ACADEMIC PROJECTS
**Multi-tier Cloud Native application on AWS (ITMO 544 - Cloud Computing Technologies)**
*AWS | EC2 | Lambda | PHP SDK | SNS | DynamoDB | CLI | Python | OpenCV*
Produced & upgraded a cloud-native application to go serverless & migrate to a NoSQL cloud database DynamoDB.
Developed a Python Lambda function on OpenCV layers to retrieve & manipulate image to save server cost.
Utilized launch configuration to implement auto-scaling and leveraged load balancer to boot EC2 instances.
**Comparing Data Paradigms for Big Data (ITMD 521 – Client Server Technologies)**
*Vagrant | Hadoop | Sqoop |Linux | Java | Graphana*
Ran custom MapReduce jobs (programmed Mapper, Reducer & Driver) on GB scale text to calculate job execution time.
Compared various configurations using datasets of different sizes and analyzed cluster using Graphana.
Transferred data from text files to MySQL database using custom Java programs and retrieved data using Sqoop.
It was found that SQL is about 15 times faster than MapReduce given that the data is already inserted.
**Bank Marketing Analysis (ITMD 527 – Data Analytics)**
*R | Naïve Bayes’ | Decision Tree | K-Nearest Neighbors | Regression | Random Forest | Neural Network*
Classified potential customers that would answer in positive when offered to buy long term loan deposit.
Built NB, DT, KNN, LR: full, stepwise forward and stepwise backward, RF and NN classification models.
KNN was determined to be the algorithm with the best accuracy of 95.17% but was also the most time costliest.
**Hospital Portal using Java EE (ITMD 515 – Advanced Software Programming)**
*Java EE | Servlet | JSP | JSF | JPQL | JavaMail*
Produced a comprehensive multi-layer enterprise application, consisting of persistence, service & presentation layers.
Implemented JSP and Servlet, then replaced it by JSF pages and backing beans.
